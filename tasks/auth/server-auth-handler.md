## Description

Implement the server-side SSH authentication logic per ADR-012:

1. **Ed25519 public key**: `auth_publickey()` checks presented key against the authorized set using constant-time comparison
2. **OpenSSH certificate authority**: validates presented certificate — checks CA signature, expiry, and principal restrictions (`permit-port-forwarding`, `no-pty`, `source-address`)

No password authentication over SSH. This is the `russh::server::Handler::auth_publickey()` implementation that the server handler will call.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `crates/wraith-core/src/auth/server_auth.rs` exports `ServerAuthConfig` and auth logic
- [ ] `ServerAuthConfig` holds: `authorized_keys: HashSet<PublicKey>`, `cert_authorities: Vec<CertAuthorityEntry>`
- [ ] `ServerAuthConfig::from_keys_and_ca()` constructor: loads authorized keys and cert-authority entries from provided key sources
- [ ] Auth check function: given a presented key/certificate, return `Accept` or `Reject`
- [ ] Ed25519 key matching uses constant-time comparison (via `russh`/`ssh-key` crate builtins)
- [ ] Certificate validation checks: CA signature valid, cert not expired, principal restrictions enforced
- [ ] Certificate options respected: `permit-port-forwarding`, `no-pty`, `source-address`
- [ ] Returns `AuthError::KeyRejected` or `AuthError::CertInvalid`/`CertExpired`/`CertPrincipalMismatch` on failure
- [ ] Unit tests: valid key accepted, invalid key rejected, cert-authority signed cert accepted, expired cert rejected, wrong principal rejected
