## Description

Meta task that clusters all auth module tasks. Once complete, the auth layer provides key loading from file or memory, server-side Ed25519 key + cert-authority validation, and client-side key-based authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All auth tasks completed
- [ ] Key loading supports file paths and in-memory data in OpenSSH format
- [ ] Server accepts Ed25519 keys and cert-authority signed certificates
- [ ] Client presents Ed25519 key pairs
- [ ] Error types cover transport, auth, channel, and config failures
