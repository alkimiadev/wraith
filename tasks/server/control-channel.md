## Description

Implement the control channel routing per ADR-018. When the server receives a `channel_open_direct_tcpip` request for `wraith-control:0`:

1. The handler detects the reserved `wraith-` prefix destination
2. Instead of making a TCP connection, it bridges the SSH channel to an internal event bus handle
3. `EventEnvelope` JSON flows bidirectionally over the SSH channel

The entire `wraith-` prefix is reserved — no TCP connections should be attempted for `wraith-*` destinations. The control channel is optional; servers without pubsub configured should accept the channel and provide a configurable behavior (reject or provide a loopback pipe).

At this stage, implement the routing logic and a `ControlChannel` trait that consumers can implement. The actual pubsub bridge implementation would be in a separate crate or behind a feature flag.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `crates/wraith-core/src/server/control_channel.rs` exports `ControlChannelHandler` trait and routing logic
- [ ] `WRAITH_CONTROL_DESTINATION` constant defined as `"wraith-control"` (ADR-018)
- [ ] `WRAITH_PREFIX` constant defined as `"wraith-"` for namespace reservation
- [ ] `ControlChannelHandler` trait: `async fn handle_channel(stream: Box<dyn AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin + Send>)`
- [ ] Server handler detects `wraith-*` prefix and routes to `ControlChannelHandler` instead of TCP proxy
- [ ] If no `ControlChannelHandler` configured, reject the channel open request (SSH channel open failure)
- [ ] Non-reserved destinations continue through normal TCP proxy path
- [ ] Server constraint enforced: no TCP connections to `wraith-*` destinations
- [ ] Unit tests: reserved destination detected, non-reserved passes through, prefix matching works
