## Description

Set up the napi-rs project for the `@alkdev/wraith` Node.js native addon. This includes the napi-rs build configuration, TypeScript type definitions, and the package structure.

Per ADR-015 and ADR-016: napi-rs is the FFI bridge, and the wrapper exposes `connect()` and `serve()` functions. The NAPI layer is transport-agnostic — it doesn't know about pubsub's `EventEnvelope`.

The Cargo.toml skeleton was created in setup/project-init. This task configures the actual napi-rs build pipeline, TypeScript types, and verifies the build works.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `crates/wraith-napi/` has `Cargo.toml` with `crate-type = ["cdylib"]`, `napi` and `napi-derive` dependencies
- [ ] `crates/wraith-napi/src/lib.rs` with napi module registration
- [ ] `packages/wraith-napi/` directory (or similar) with `package.json` named `@alkdev/wraith`
- [ ] `packages/wraith-napi/tsconfig.json` for TypeScript type generation
- [ ] TypeScript type definitions for `WraithConnectOptions`, `WraithServeOptions`, `WraithServer`, `ConnectionInfo` matching napi-and-pubsub.md interfaces
- [ ] `napi.config.js` or `NapiRs.config` with correct cargo path, module name
- [ ] Build command: `npm run build` builds the native addon
- [ ] Feature flags: `iroh` feature optional; base package includes tcp + tls
- [ ] `npm install` and initial build succeed
