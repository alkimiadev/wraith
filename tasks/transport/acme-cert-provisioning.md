## Description

Implement automatic TLS certificate provisioning via ACME (Let's Encrypt). Two modes per ADR-008:

1. **Domain-based ACME** (`--acme-domain`): Standard flow with HTTP-01 or TLS-ALPN-01 challenges. Domain-bound, auto-renewing.
2. **IP-based ACME**: Short-lived certs via TLS-ALPN-01 on port 443. No domain needed.

Uses `rustls-acme` (pure Rust) to avoid external certbot dependency. Feature-gated behind `acme` (implies `tls`).

This integrates with `TlsAcceptor` by providing ACME-resolved certificates instead of manual cert/key files.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `crates/wraith-core/src/transport/acme.rs` (behind `#[cfg(feature = "acme")]`)
- [ ] Feature `acme` implies `tls` in Cargo.toml
- [ ] `AcmeCertProvider` struct accepts: domain (domain-based) or IP mode flag
- [ ] Domain-based mode: uses `rustls-acme` with HTTP-01/TLS-ALPN-01 challenge responder
- [ ] IP-based mode: uses `rustls-acme` with TLS-ALPN-01 on port 443
- [ ] `AcmeCertProvider` produces a `rustls::ServerConfig` that `TlsAcceptor` can use
- [ ] Certificate auto-renewal handled by `rustls-acme` background task
- [ ] `TlsAcceptor` updated to accept either manual certs OR an `AcmeCertProvider`
- [ ] Integration with `TlsAcceptor::bind_acme()` or similar constructor
- [ ] Unit tests for ACME config construction (challenge responder setup)
- [ ] Integration test: ACME cert provisioning with Let's Encrypt staging (marked `#[ignore]` for CI)

## Notes

- `AcmeCertProvider` is the main entry point. It creates `AcmeState` and `ResolvesServerCertAcme` from `rustls-acme`.
- The `ResolvesServerCertAcme` resolver is shared between the `AcmeState` background task and the `ServerConfig`, so cert updates propagate automatically.
- `AcmeTlsAcceptor::bind_acme()` creates a TLS acceptor that uses ACME-provisioned certs and spawns a background tokio task for auto-renewal.
- `TlsAcceptor::bind_acme()` also added for users who want to use ACME with the standard `TlsAcceptor` type directly.
- The `AcmeConfig` stub in `tls.rs` is retained for backward compat with existing `TlsAcceptor::bind()`.
- `acme` feature implies `tls` and adds `rustls-acme` + `futures` dependencies.
- TLS-ALPN-01 challenge handling works via the `acme-tls/1` ALPN protocol registered in `ServerConfig` — the resolver dispatches challenge vs regular certs automatically.

## Summary

Implemented ACME/Let's Encrypt certificate provisioning (ADR-008) behind the `acme` feature flag. `AcmeCertProvider` supports domain-based and IP-based modes using `rustls-acme`. `AcmeTlsAcceptor::bind_acme()` and `TlsAcceptor::bind_acme()` provide ACME-integrated TLS acceptance with automatic certificate renewal via a background tokio task. Unit tests cover config construction, builder patterns, and server config generation. Integration test for LE staging is marked `#[ignore]`.
