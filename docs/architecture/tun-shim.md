# TUN Shim (Deprecated)

> **Note**: TUN functionality has been deferred from the wraith project. For VPN-like "route all traffic" behavior, use `tun2proxy` alongside wraith's SOCKS5 proxy. See ADR-014 for the rationale.

## What Changed

The `wraith-tun` separate process and all TUN-related code is out of scope. The recommended approach for VPN-like behavior is:

```bash
# Terminal 1: wraith SOCKS5 proxy (no root required)
wraith connect --server example.com --identity ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Terminal 2: tun2proxy routes all traffic through wraith's SOCKS5
sudo tun2proxy --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
```

This keeps the core wraith binary free of TUN complexity and leverages an existing, well-tested tool for TUN-to-SOCKS5 bridging.
