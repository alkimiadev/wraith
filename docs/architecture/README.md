## Open Questions

All open questions have been resolved. See [open-questions.md](open-questions.md) for details on each resolution.

## Lifecycle Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Transitions |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `draft` | Under active development. May change significantly. | → `reviewed` when open questions resolved |
| `reviewed` | Architecture final. Implementation may begin. Changes require review. | → `stable` when implementation verified |
| `stable` | Locked. Changes require review and may warrant an ADR. | → `deprecated` when superseded |
| `deprecated` | Superseded. Kept for reference. | Removed when no longer referenced |
