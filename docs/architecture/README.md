# Wraith Architecture

## Current State

Architecture specification reviewed and ready for implementation. 19 ADRs accepted. Configuration architecture under exploration — see [research/configuration.md](../research/configuration.md).

## Architecture Documents

| Document | Status | Description |

| [overview.md](overview.md) | reviewed | Package purpose, exports, dependencies |
| [transport.md](transport.md) | reviewed | Transport abstraction: TCP, TLS, iroh |
| [client.md](client.md) | reviewed | Client connection, SOCKS5, port forwarding |
| [server.md](server.md) | reviewed | Server acceptance, channel handling, proxy |
| [tun-shim.md](tun-shim.md) | deprecated | TUN interface wrapper — **deferred**, use tun2proxy |
| [napi-and-pubsub.md](napi-and-pubsub.md) | reviewed | NAPI wrapper and pubsub event target adapter |

## Open Questions

Most open questions have been resolved. New questions from configuration
research — see [open-questions.md](open-questions.md) for details.

## Lifecycle Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Transitions |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `draft` | Under active development. May change significantly. | → `reviewed` when open questions resolved |
| `reviewed` | Architecture final. Implementation may begin. Changes require review. | → `stable` when implementation verified |
| `stable` | Locked. Changes require review and may warrant an ADR. | → `deprecated` when superseded |
| `deprecated` | Superseded. Kept for reference. | Removed when no longer referenced |
